### 📄 Documentation_B — Design and Manufacturing Preparation

This section covers the hardware design process completed in KiCad, including schematic capture, PCB layout, and preparation for manufacturing. The schematic was created to define all electrical connections and functional blocks, followed by PCB layout with component placement, routing, ground pours, and signal integrity considerations. Board identification elements such as designer name, project labeling, and university branding were added to the silkscreen. Final checks (ERC/DRC) were performed, and manufacturing files (Gerbers and drill files) were generated to prepare the board for fabrication.
